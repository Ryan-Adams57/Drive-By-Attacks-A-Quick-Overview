Drive-By Attack.

A drive-by attack, or drive-by download attack, is a type of cyberattack where a malicious script prompts a program to download and install itself on a userâ€™s device without their explicit consent.

This can occur on any device and operating system. Typically, these attacks happen when a user visits and interacts with a compromised web page.
